# Blackjack Game

This repository contains a simple Blackjack game implemented mostly using JavaScript. The game allows players to play the classic casino card game against a computer dealer.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/blackjack-game.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd blackjack-game
```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to start the game.

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game. The objective of Blackjack is to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. The game will deal cards to you and the dealer, and you can choose to "Hit" (get another card) or "Stand" (keep your current hand). The dealer will reveal their face-down card after you've made your decision.

5. If your hand value exceeds 21, you bust and lose the game. If your hand value is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand, you win. If the dealer's hand value is closer to 21, you lose. If both you and the dealer have the same hand value, it's a tie (push).
